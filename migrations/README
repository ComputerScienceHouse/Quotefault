## What are Alembic and migrations?
Migrations give a versioned history of changes to the SQL Schema for this project.
A `revision` or `migration` defines changes to the structure of the database (such as adding/dropping tables or columns), as well as procedures for migrating existing data to the new structure. Migrations allow for safe(ish) rollbacks, and make it easier to make incremental changes to the database.

## Applying migrations
Once you have your db URI in `config.py`, run `flask db upgrade` to bring the db up to the latest revision.

## Creating new revisions
When you change `models.py`, you'll need to make a new migration.
Run `flask db revision -m "<descriptive title>"` to autogenerate one.
You should go manually inspect the created revision to make sure it does what you expect.
Once you've got your changes all set, be sure to commit the migration file in the same commit as your changes to `models.py`
