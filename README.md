# quotefault
quote-submission system for CSH Segfault editors as well as CSH InfoSys

Intial (Hackathon 1/14/17) goals:
Allow users to access the QuoteFault Main page and submit a quote and name to the system; Have flask/mySQL utilities collect the two pieces of user input, as well as a datetime stamp and store them; Display the data collected on a seperate, password-protected page in date-submitted order for Segfault editors to view

Long-term goals:
Allow InfoSys to access the database and take one quote a day and display it in the user-center once per hour; Allow Segfault editors to delete old/used quotes from the database at any time; Appearance improvements
